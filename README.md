Note
This project uses Chrome driver and it requires Chrome driver binary. You need to download and set webdriver.chrome.driver property in application.properties file with driver binary path.

Locators are separated from code (com.brighte.loc). This approach has two benefits:

First of all, you donâ€™t need to hardcode or fix strategy for locator in code. With qaf locator strategy you can easily switch from one locator to another locator either strategy or locator value.
Secondly, you can separate out locator outside your code by using locator repository, where you can maintain locator without code change
There is one POM (Page Object Model): CalculatePostagePage located at com.aupost.pom and the project uses excel file as data driven test.

BDD are located at scenarios.com.brighte.features

Steps are located at com.brighte.steps
